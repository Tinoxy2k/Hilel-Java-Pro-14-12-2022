Mark Twain's publication in 1876 of his popular novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
reversed a brief downturn in his success following the publication of his previous novel,
The Gilded Age. Twain wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer while he and his family were living
in Hartford, Connecticut, and while Twain was enjoying his fame. The novel, which tells of the
escapades of a young boy and his friends in St. Petersburg, Missouri, a village near the Mississippi
 River, recalls Twain's own childhood in a small Missouri town. The friendship of Tom Sawyer and Huck
 Finn is one of the most celebrated in American literature, built on imaginative adventures, shared
 superstitions, and loyalty that rises above social convention. Twain's American reading audience loved
 this novel and its young hero, and the novel remains one of the most popular and famous works of American
 literature. The novel and its characters have achieved folk hero status in the American popular imagination.
 Scenes such as Tom Sawyer tricking his friends into whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence for him, Injun Joe leaping
  through the window of the courthouse after Tom names him as Dr. Robinson's murderer, and Tom and Becky lost in
  the cave have become so familiar to American readers that one almost doesn't have to read the book to know about
  them. But the pleasure of reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer has kept readers coming back to the novel for over a
  century. Beyond the fact that The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is fun to read, there is another reason for the novel's
  contemporary popularity: It introduces the character of Huckleberry Finn, who, with the publication of Twain's 1884 novel,
  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, would become one of the greatest characters in American literature.
